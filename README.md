# GravTesseroid
## About
GravTesseroid is a collection of matlab scripts for modeling the gravitational potential of a tesseroid and its first and second order derivatives.

The geometry of a tesseroid is show in Fig.1

The first version v1.0 mainly contains fundamental functions for modeling the gravitatinal attraction of a tesseroid and employs three kinds of approaches to perform the forward modeling.These methods areï¼š

1. Gauss-Legendre quadrature (3D GLQ)
2. Taylor series expansion (TSE)
3. prism approximation (PA)
