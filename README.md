# GravTesseroid
## About
GravTesseroid is a collection of matlab scripts for modeling the gravitational potential of a tesseroid and its first and second order derivatives.
The first version v1.0 mainly contains fundamental functions for modeling the gravitatinal attraction of a tesseroid and employs three kinds of approaches Gauss-Legendre quadrature, Taylor series expansion and prism approximation method to perform the forward modeling.
